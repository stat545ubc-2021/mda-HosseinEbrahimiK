# Preliminaries

First, let's load the packages we want to work with.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(datateachr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

If you do not have [`datateachr`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) installed, run the following code in your **R terminal**.
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")
```

## Task1.1

Top 4 personal appealing datasets:

1. cancer_sample
2. vancouver_trees
3. building_permits
4. apt_buildings

## Task1.2
First, to familiarize more with each dataset, we take look at class type, number of rows, number of columns, variables' name, and type of each variable for each dataset. These properties could be obtained by `class()`, `dim()` and `glimpse()` functions.

### Cancer sample dataset
For this sepcific dataset, it is useful to see decription of variables availaibe at [`UCI Machine Learning Breast Cancer Wisconsin`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The summary is provided below:

**Variables Information**:

1. ID number
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

### Vancouver trees dataset
The general information about the dataset that is obtained from [`Vancouver Open Portal`](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/street-trees/information/?disjunctive.species_name&disjunctive.common_name&disjunctive.height_range_id&dataChart=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%3D%3D).

The street tree dataset includes a listing of public trees on boulevards in the City of Vancouver and provides data on tree coordinates, species and other related characteristics. Park trees and private trees are not included in the inventory.

**Data currency**

The dataset is updated on a weekly basis. However, tree attributes are generally not updated on a regular basis and it may be several years between updates for many of those attributes. Priorities and resources determine how fast a change in reality is reflected in the data.
The coordinates were primarily provided by the 2016 Tree Inventory project.

**Data accuracy**

Tree attributes are generally not updated on a regular basis and it may be several years between updates for many of those attributes.

The coordinates and/or addresses are incorrect for these Trees ID: **21616, 115677, 139140, 209663, 209664, 213592, 255944, 256303**

**Note**: 0 value in latitude and longitude fields mean there is no related information available.

### Building permits dataset
The general information about the dataset that is obtained from [`Vancouver Open Portal`](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/).

Building permits are required for new buildings, additions or alterations to existing buildings, and for demolitions or salvage and abatement work.

This dataset includes information of all building permits issued by the City of Vancouver, starting in 2017. The data is based on permit issuance date and does not show current status of a permit, or changes after a permit is originally issued.

**Data currency**

The extract for the current year is updated weekly but the extract for prior year is static.

**Data accuracy**

There may be some loss of quality from data entry errors and omissions, in particular where the original application date was prior to May 2016 (when permit software changed).

### Apartment buildings

The general information about the dataset that is obtained from [`Toronto Open Data`](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/issued-building-permits/information/).

The Apartment Building Standard (ABS) program is based on a new bylaw Chapter 354, which defines formal criteria to identify all rental apartment buildings in the city with 3 or more storeys and 10 or more units. The ABS program is part of RentSafeTO which is a multi-residential inspection program that establishes standards on how building owners operate their building(s) and communicate with their tenants, in addition to establishing a schedule for continuous building evaluation, audit and enforcement of these standards.

This dataset contains building information for the buildings that are registered in the ABS program. This information was collected from building owners/managers during the initial registration process, and is updated on an annual basis as part of the registration renewal process.

## Task1.3

The most two interesting datasets for me are cancer_sample and Vancouver_trees datasets. For the cancer dataset, I am curious about how different aspects of a cellâ€™s nuclei attribute to cancer and whether there is any correlation between them. Also, most of its variables are numeric, which makes it easy to analyze.

I would like to find out the different types of trees overall and in each neighborhood within this dataset. It has different variables such as date, numeric, and characters that make it interesting to analyze. Also, finding the oldest recorded trees in Vancouver was really exciting to me.

```{r}
oldest_tree <- vancouver_trees %>%
  arrange(date_planted) %>%
  filter(date_planted == first(date_planted)) %>%
  select(std_street, neighbourhood_name, date_planted, latitude, longitude)

oldest_tree
```

## Task1.4

Cancer_sample: What factor makes cancer cells most distinguishable from normal cells? In other words, if we have to only look at one feature to see if the cell is cancerous or not, which feature gives us the most confidence in our prediction?

Vancouver_trees: For each tree species, does the neighborhood the tree has grown affect the tree's growth (height or diameter)? What factors have made a neighborhood best for them?

Based on these question and overall properties of datasets, I would like to explore Vancouver_trees dataset.

# Task2 (2.1 and 2.2)
1. What is the density distribution of the diameter of trees in Vancouver? Since the diameter is being used to calculate the age of a tree, seeing this distribution gives us a rough idea about the distribution of age.

```{r}
dmtr <- vancouver_trees %>%
  ggplot(aes(diameter)) +
  geom_density(fill='blue')

print(dmtr)
```

```{r}
outlier <- vancouver_trees %>%
  filter(diameter > 50) %>%
  nrow()
outlier
```
Since there are only 153 trees (total entries: 146,611) with more than 50.0 diameters (outliers), we filter them out to have a better understanding of the distribution.

```{r}
dmtr_dist <- vancouver_trees %>%
  filter(diameter < 50) %>% # filtering outliers
  ggplot(aes(diameter)) +
  geom_density(fill='blue')

print(dmtr_dist)
```

2. In the last section, we mentioned the relation between the diameter and age of a tree. For this part, let's calculate the age of trees based on the date planted and `Sys.Date()`. [source of year extraction](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37707060/converting-data-frame-column-from-character-to-numeric/37707117).

```{r}
van_tree_wAge <- vancouver_trees %>%
  # Extracting year from date format and convert it to numeric value
  mutate(age = as.numeric(format(as.Date(Sys.Date(),format="%Y-%m-%d"),"%Y")) -
           as.numeric(format(as.Date(date_planted,format="%Y-%m-%d"),"%Y"))) %>%
  select(tree_id, date_planted, age, everything())


head(van_tree_wAge)
```

3. Now that we have the age variable, we can explore the relationship between the age of trees and the neighborhood in order to see how age is distributed in each area.

```{r}
age_nghbr_rel <- van_tree_wAge %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, neighbourhood_name)) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.5)
  
print(age_nghbr_rel)
```

4. For this section, I want to create a tibble with neighbourhood_name, the most dominant tree species (based on the count), and its count for each neighborhood.

```{r}
dmnnt_trees <- vancouver_trees %>%
  group_by(neighbourhood_name) %>%
  count(species_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(1)
  
  
print(dmnnt_trees)
```

# Task 3

1. Which types of trees have been planted the most in the past ten years in each neighborhood? In other words, is there a trend in cultivated tree species in each area?

2. Is there any kind of relation between the height of trees (with the same type) and the neighborhood they have been planted in?

3. Within each neighborhood, do trees with a curb around them tend to have smaller diameters (in terms of growth)?

4. Could we validate within the dataset that the age of a tree directly relates to its diameter? Is it the same rate among all tree species, or it differs from one to another?
